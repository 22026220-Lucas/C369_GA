    <h1>Laundering and Fraud Protection</h1>
    <p>At CapiBank, we are dedicated to providing a secure and safe environment for our customers. Our webpage has some features designed to protect our customers from fraud and prevent money laundering. To ensure the safety and integrity of our customers' financial transactions, here's how our features work:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Secure Login Process:</strong> Our webpage features a secure login process, in which customers are required to enter their unique login credentials that include a user ID and pin number. We highly encourage our customers to choose complex user IDs and regularly update them every 3 months to prevent unauthorized access to their accounts.</li>
      <li><strong>Account Activity Monitoring:</strong> Our webpage constantly monitors customer account activity, and any suspicious or unusual transactions, such as large transfers or multiple login attempts, will trigger alerts for further investigation. CapiBank will monitor these alerts closely to identify and prevent any fraudulent activities.</li>
      <li><strong>Setting Transaction Limits:</strong> Our webpage has a fixed limit of money customers can transfer for every transaction, which helps prevent any excessive or unauthorized transactions from taking place within a specified time frame.</li>
      <li><strong>Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Measures:</strong> We strictly adhere to regulatory requirements and have implemented AML measures on our webpage. This includes customer verification processes, enhanced due diligence checks for high-risk transactions, and continuous monitoring of customer accounts for any suspicious financial activities.</li>
      <li><strong>Advanced Fraud Detection Systems:</strong> Our webpage is equipped with advanced fraud detection systems powered by machine learning algorithms. These systems help analyze customer transaction patterns, account behavior, and other factors to identify potential fraud. Any unusual or suspicious activities are flagged for further investigation and preventive measures.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>By incorporating these features and implementing strict security measures, we aim to safeguard our customers' accounts, protect them from fraud, and prevent money laundering activities. Our commitment to enhanced security, continuous monitoring, and customer education allows us to provide a secure and reliable online banking experience for our valued customers. Thank you for your understanding, and we hope you have a pleasant experience using our service!</p>
